# Rules of thumb for a 1x developer

10x Developers are like unicorns, they do not exist. If they do, I bet they have no work/life balance. A more pragmatic philosophy is the 1x Developer brought to you by Micky Wiki. Really resonated with me.

## The short:

* Even machines needs to be turn off, to cool done. You can still produce great stuff between 9-5 and have time for family/friends/hobbies.
* Rule 2 out 20, Most of what I learn is useless outside of its immediate context. ***Learn something that is transferable!***
* Rule 3 out 20, Focus “learning time” on things that compound.
